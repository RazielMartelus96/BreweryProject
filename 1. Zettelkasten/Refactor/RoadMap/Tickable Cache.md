# Tickable Cache
This is a potential way of sorting the [[Caching Of Brews]] problem, along with general caching techniques, within brewery: 
- JSinco was thinking of abstracting it all by creating an interface called ‘Tickable’ and brewery will tick barrels/cauldrons to match it to a recipe. 
- We would need to create some kind of recipe matcher, so that recipes can be within margins.
- Realistically JSinco thinks this’ll be the hardest part about barrel/cauldron aging,having some system to match recipes within margin
