# PaperLib

Due to the issues with [[Use of InventoryHolder| Inventory Holders]] it is proposed we use PaperLib for the purposes of ensuring performance issues are only effect Brewery on Spigot Servers. 
I believe if this is done we should interface out the logic to a composite "Brew Inventory Handler" that is init within the BrewManager. 

On top of that clear documentation for Spigot servers should be made. 

*i.e. a warning to spigot users to inform them of the potential performance loss*
