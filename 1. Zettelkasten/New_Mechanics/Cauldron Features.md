# Cauldron Features
So due to many changes to the Cauldron API over the last few versions of minecraft, there are several things we could do to further customise the Cauldron itself. This can include:

-  [[Different Cauldron Materials]]Allowing users to specify different materials that can be the base liquid within a Cauldron. 
-  [[Indicative Particle Effects]] Allowing for the gradual climb in effect colour until the potion colour is reached (as a secondary indicator and just looking cool)
