# Caching Of Brews
There has been a long standing problem with brews that is, to be frank, they are slow to load when opening inventories, closing inventories etc. 

Some of this is due to the base-nature of spigot, others might be bad code. As such it would be worth investigating if there was a way to cache inventory's brews, to prevent reconstruction / snapshotting by just calling the cached brews in future calls.
